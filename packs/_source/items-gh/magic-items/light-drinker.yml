      <p><em>Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)</em></p>
      <p>This longsword has a blade of dark, almost black steel that seems to
      absorb light around it. When drawn, nearby light sources dim slightly
      and shadows deepen. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made
      with this magic weapon.</p>
      <p><strong>Light Absorption.</strong> When you hit a creature with this
      weapon, the blade absorbs some of the target's life force. The target
      takes an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points
      equal to the necrotic damage dealt.</p>
      <p><strong>Darkness Shroud.</strong> As a bonus action, you can command
      the sword to consume all light in a 15-foot radius around you, creating
      an area of magical darkness that lasts until the start of your next
      turn. You can see normally in this darkness. Once you use this property,
      you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
