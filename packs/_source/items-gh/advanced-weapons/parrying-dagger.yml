      <p>A specially designed off-hand dagger with a wide guard, built for
      deflecting enemy blows and disarming opponents. Its versatile design
      allows it to be used for both defense and offense.</p>
      <p><strong>Disarming.</strong> When you hit a creature with this weapon,
      you can attempt to disarm them. The target must succeed on a Strength
      saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength
      or Dexterity modifier) or drop one item of your choice that it is
      holding. The item lands at its feet.</p>
      <p><strong>Defending.</strong> When you are wielding this weapon, you
      can use a reaction to add +1 to your AC against one melee attack that
      would hit you. You must be able to see the attacker.</p>
      <p><strong>Finesse.</strong> When making an attack with this weapon, you
      can use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the
      attack and damage rolls.</p>
      <p><strong>Light.</strong> This weapon is small and easy to handle,
      making it ideal for two-weapon fighting.</p>
      <p><strong>Thrown (20/60).</strong> This weapon can be thrown to make a
      ranged attack with the listed range.</p>
