      <p>You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, the next creature
      hit by the weapon must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or receive
      a festering wound. A creature with a festering wound takes 2d6 necrotic
      damage at the beginning of its turn for the remainder of the spell's
      duration. A creature can only have one festering wound at a
      time.</p><p>Receiving at least 1 point of magical healing closes a
      festering wound, ending the recurring damage and the
      spell.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the damage
      dealt by a festering wound by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
