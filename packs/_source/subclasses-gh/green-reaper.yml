      <p>The Green Reaper is a ranger archetype that specializes in the use of
      poisons and venoms gathered from the natural world. These rangers are
      experts in toxicology, using their knowledge of plants, fungi, and
      venomous creatures to coat their weapons and craft deadly concoctions
      that weaken and destroy their prey.</p>

      <h3>Green Reaper Magic</h3>
      <p><em>3rd-level Green Reaper feature</em></p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach
      certain levels in this class. The spell counts as a ranger spell for
      you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you
      know.</p>

      <h3>Envenomed Attack</h3>
      <p><em>3rd-level Green Reaper feature</em></p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you learn to harvest and apply natural venoms to your
      weapons. As a bonus action, you can apply poison to a weapon or piece
      of ammunition. The next time you hit a creature with that weapon or
      ammunition, the creature takes an extra 1d6 poison damage and must
      succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your ranger spell save
      DC or be poisoned until the end of your next turn. The extra damage
      increases to 2d6 at 11th level. You can use this feature a number of
      times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain
      all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h3>Toxic Tradecraft</h3>
      <p><em>3rd-level Green Reaper feature</em></p>
      <p>Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the poisoner's kit. If
      you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with the
      herbalism kit instead. You have advantage on saving throws against being
      poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.</p>

      <h3>Poison Control</h3>
      <p><em>7th-level Green Reaper feature</em></p>
      <p>Beginning at 7th level, when you deal poison damage to a creature that
      is resistant to poison damage, you can ignore that resistance. If a
      creature is immune to poison damage, it is treated as having resistance
      instead (which you then ignore). Additionally, when a creature fails its
      saving throw against your Envenomed Attack, you can choose one of the
      following additional effects: its speed is halved until the end of your
      next turn, it can't take reactions until the end of your next turn, or
      it has disadvantage on the next ability check it makes before the end
      of your next turn.</p>

      <h3>Variegated Vexations</h3>
      <p><em>11th-level Green Reaper feature</em></p>
      <p>At 11th level, your poisons become supernaturally potent. When you use
      your Envenomed Attack feature, you can choose to change the damage type
      from poison to acid or necrotic. Additionally, creatures poisoned by your
      Envenomed Attack have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to
      maintain concentration on spells.</p>

      <h3>Pain Tolerance</h3>
      <p><em>15th-level Green Reaper feature</em></p>
      <p>Starting at 15th level, you become immune to the poisoned condition
      and to poison damage. Additionally, when a creature fails its saving
      throw against your Envenomed Attack by 5 or more, it is also stunned
      until the end of your next turn.</p>
