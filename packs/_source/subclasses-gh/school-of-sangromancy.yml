      <p>The School of Sangromancy focuses on the arcane power hidden within
      blood. Sangromancers learn to harness their own vitality as a source of
      magical power, fueling their spells with life force and gaining mastery
      over the crimson fluid that flows through all living creatures.</p>

      <h3>Sangromancy Savant</h3>
      <p><em>2nd-level School of Sangromancy feature</em></p>
      <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
      you must spend to copy a spell from the necromancy or transmutation school
      into your spellbook is halved.</p>

      <h3>Full-Blooded</h3>
      <p><em>2nd-level School of Sangromancy feature</em></p>
      <p>Starting at 2nd level, when you expend hit dice as part of casting a
      spell, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the number of hit points
      you regain from each hit die spent (minimum of 1). Additionally, when you
      cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage or restores
      hit points, you can expend one hit die, rolling it and regaining hit
      points equal to the result plus your Intelligence modifier.</p>

      <h3>Sanguine Vigor</h3>
      <p><em>6th-level School of Sangromancy feature</em></p>
      <p>Beginning at 6th level, when you are reduced to half your hit point
      maximum or fewer, you gain a bonus to your spell save DC and spell attack
      rolls equal to +1. This bonus increases to +2 when you are at or below
      one quarter of your hit point maximum.</p>

      <h3>Blood for Blood</h3>
      <p><em>10th-level School of Sangromancy feature</em></p>
      <p>Starting at 10th level, when a creature within 60 feet of you that you
      can see takes damage, you can use your reaction to expend a hit die.
      Roll the hit die and add your Intelligence modifier; the creature takes
      additional necrotic damage equal to the total. You regain hit points equal
      to half the necrotic damage dealt (rounded down). You can use this feature
      a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once),
      and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h3>Red Renewal</h3>
      <p><em>14th-level School of Sangromancy feature</em></p>
      <p>Beginning at 14th level, when you finish a short rest, you regain a
      number of expended hit dice equal to half your wizard level (rounded
      down), in addition to any hit dice you would normally regain. Furthermore,
      when you cast a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that has a casting time
      of one action, you can expend two hit dice to cast it as a bonus action
      instead.</p>
