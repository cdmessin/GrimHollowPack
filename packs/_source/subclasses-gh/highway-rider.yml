      <p>The Highway Rider is a rogue who has taken to the saddle, becoming a
      daring outlaw or frontier scout who strikes fast and rides hard. These
      rogues are expert mounted combatants, using speed and surprise to
      outmaneuver their foes before vanishing into the dust.</p>

      <h3>Hair Trigger</h3>
      <p><em>3rd-level Highway Rider feature</em></p>
      <p>When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with
      martial ranged weapons. Additionally, you can draw or stow up to two
      weapons as part of each of your turns (instead of one), and being within
      5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged
      attack rolls.</p>

      <h3>Trusty Mount</h3>
      <p><em>3rd-level Highway Rider feature</em></p>
      <p>At 3rd level, you gain a loyal mount. You can spend 8 hours bonding
      with a horse or similar beast. While bonded, the mount gains hit points
      equal to your rogue level x 3, and it adds your proficiency bonus to
      its AC and saving throws. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new
      one after a long rest. While mounted on your bonded mount, you can use
      your Cunning Action to command the mount to take the Dash, Disengage,
      or Dodge action.</p>

      <h3>Ride Them Down</h3>
      <p><em>3rd-level Highway Rider feature</em></p>
      <p>Starting at 3rd level, if your mount moves at least 20 feet straight
      toward a creature before you make a melee weapon attack against it on
      the same turn, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage. This extra damage
      can be combined with your Sneak Attack. Additionally, the target must
      succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency
      bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or be knocked prone.</p>

      <h3>Horse Lord</h3>
      <p><em>9th-level Highway Rider feature</em></p>
      <p>At 9th level, while mounted on your bonded mount, you have advantage
      on melee attack rolls against any unmounted creature that is smaller
      than your mount. Additionally, when your mount is subjected to an effect
      that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage,
      it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
      half damage if it fails. Your mount's speed also increases by 10
      feet.</p>

      <h3>True Grit</h3>
      <p><em>13th-level Highway Rider feature</em></p>
      <p>Beginning at 13th level, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not
      killed outright, you can make a single weapon attack as a reaction before
      falling unconscious. If this attack hits, you regain hit points equal to
      twice your rogue level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again
      until you finish a long rest.</p>

      <h3>Desperado</h3>
      <p><em>17th-level Highway Rider feature</em></p>
      <p>At 17th level, you can take two turns during the first round of any
      combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your
      second turn at your initiative minus 10. Additionally, while mounted,
      opportunity attacks against you and your mount are made with
      disadvantage.</p>
