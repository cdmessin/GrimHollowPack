Don't edit the packs/spells-gh files directly, they are built from the _source/spells-gh files which are the editable ones.

To get valid icon paths for spell images, run `bash utils/list-valid-icons.sh` — it extracts all image paths used in the dnd5e example module under `examples/dnd5e/packs/src/spells/`.
